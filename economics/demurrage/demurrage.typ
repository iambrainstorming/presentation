#text( fill: rgb("#2196F3"))[1. Fixed Supply → Predictability]

Demurrage keeps total supply fixed.
Inflation constantly expands supply, reducing predictability and long-term trust.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#9C27B0"))[2. Encourages Circulation, Not Hoarding]

Demurrage penalizes idle balances.
Inflation penalizes everyone equally, including active users.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#E91E63"))[3. Redistribution Instead of Dilution]

Inflation benefits early receivers of new money.
Demurrage sends deductions to the treasury → then to contributors and workers.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#FF5722"))[4. Eliminates the Cantillon Effect]

No hidden money printing.
No insider advantage.
All deductions are transparent and fairly distributed.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#4CAF50"))[5. Incentives Aligned With Contribution]

Passive holders slowly lose share.
Active contributors gain from treasury redistribution.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#FFC107"))[6. Reduces Speculation]

Demurrage discourages long-term hoarding and “store-of-value worship”.
Economy shifts toward actual utility, not price gambling.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#03A9F4"))[7. Treasury Funding Without Taxes]

Demurrage generates a continuous treasury flow
without printing money and without raising taxes.
Ideal for DAOs, public goods, open-source ecosystems.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#00BCD4"))[8. Better for Public Goods]

Instead of funding insiders, treasury funds flow directly to:
• educators
• researchers
• builders
• maintainers
• civic contributors

---

#text( fill: rgb("#8BC34A"))[9. Increases Economic Velocity]

Demurrage keeps money moving —
more trade, more activity, more opportunity.

---

#text( fill: rgb("#FFEB3B"))[10. Does Not Require Ever-Increasing Demand]

Inflation *requires* more buyers, more users, and growing demand
just to maintain value and prevent collapse.

Demurrage *does not depend on exponential demand*.
Value remains stable because supply stays fixed —
only percentage shares shift.

#text(fill: rgb("#4CAF50"))[Demurrage → A More Honest Monetary System]

A currency that rewards contribution,
penalizes hoarding,
funds public goods,
and doesn’t rely on artificial growth.

Fixed supply.
Transparent redistribution.
Sustainable economics.

#text(fill: rgb("#FF9800"))[Demurrage Can't Work With Central Planning]

Demurrage fails under centralized control.
Treasury redistribution cannot be managed by a single authority —
it becomes political, corruptible, and inefficient.

Demurrage requires *decentralized governance*,
where redistribution is transparent, algorithmic, and community-driven.

Different economic networks and supply chains also need their own
*independent currencies*, enabling a multi-currency ecosystem
instead of one centrally planned system.
